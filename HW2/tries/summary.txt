| bigger training batch size             | 99.98        | 53.43       | 8:47    | In this run, I kept the changes from the Adam try because it gave me a slightly better result than the baseline submission, and I also changed the batch size of the training dataloader to be bigger (2000 vs 64).  |
| smaller training batch size            | 99.54        | 51.35       | 22:42   | In this run, I kept the changes from the bigger batch size try, only that I adjusted the batch size to be smaller (32 vs the original 64).                                                                           |
| augmented test dataset, not normalized | 98.21        | 12.61       | 17:19   | In this run, I used augmented the test dataset but I cut the image normalizations.                                                                                                                                   |
